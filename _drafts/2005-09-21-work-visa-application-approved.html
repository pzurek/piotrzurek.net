<strong>Finally!</strong>
During the breakfast at Ambassador hotel (sounds better then actually is) in Hamilton, I received a call from a lady from the New Zealand Immigration Serviced. After a long and stressful wait my work visa application got finally approved. I would have to leave New Zealand in a week if I didn't get it...
Right now I can officially join the CADPRO team. The next big goal is getting the car.
