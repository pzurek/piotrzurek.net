So, this weekend we headed north, to Bay of Islands. Going there, thereis one thing You have to do. Go for  a dolphin watching/swimming cruise.This time we haven't been so lucky during the swimming part (no underwater pictures) but the watching was just perfect. We've seen ahuge pod with some very young and very big individuals. Great fun for usand judging by their behavior for them as well.
