As of yesterday I can finally produce a nice png drawing of my map. The next thing I will have to complete ASAP is Styles functionality and Property View that will allow modifying looks of each topic separately. I wish there wasn't Christmas coming so that I had no distractions from working on Psycho. It gets more and more usable and I think that the first actual release is coming in around 6 months. I'll try to produce a Road Map - of course as a mind map.
