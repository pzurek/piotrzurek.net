The last couple of weeks <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/ships/the-esperanza">Esperanza</a> - the biggest Greenpeace vessel, has been docked to Princess Wharf in Auckland. Around a year ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Grand_Bleu_(yacht)">Le Grand Bleu</a> that was docked in exactly the same place. It was really sad to see how poor Esperanza looks in that comparison. Especially when you realize the purpose that those vessels serve. And now we're hearing that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Abramovich">Roman</a> is having another yacht built for around ÂŁ200 million.
Anyway, I hope this time Auckland will be a happy beginning of a successful journey and not a tragic end like for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Warrior">Rainbow Warrior</a>.
