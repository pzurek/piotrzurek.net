A couple of weeks ago Red Hot Chili Peppers announced a concert in Poland. Well, not only in Poland but also in the city where I used to live. To top all of that - it's on my birthday!
<strong>Fabulous, right!?</strong> Not quite...
I don't live there any more. In fact, I live something like 20000 km from there and I won't be able to afford to fly there for the concert! <strong>Crap!</strong>
