...I just didn't have a good reason. Now I do. Some dicks using that creepy service have used my pictures as the background of their MySpace websites. The problem is that they didn't simply download the picture and put it up on MySpace - which I'm perfectly OK with. They linked to the source of the picture on my website effectively redirecting the traffic to it.
Why does it bother me? First of all, because it uses my limited traffic (not that I'm anywhere close the limit) and secondly because it distorts my website statistics. So, I've removed all the full size photos from the blog and some links are dead now. I was also thinking about replacing them with some nice porn shots or otherwise disturbing photos, but I guess it's not worth the effort.
