 I've got it and quick! I'm very nicely surprised with the delivery speed. It was ordered on Friday and I got it on Monday morning. Well done FedEx! The online tracking is pretty cool too:

First impressions on the <a href="http://www.di-gps.com/di-GPS/n2.htm" title="N2 di-GPS mini">N2 di-GPS</a> mini?
<ul>
	<li>Very small and lightweight - why doesn't Nikon put something like that inside the camera? Or at least inside the MB-200? It would be uber-cool and rather unique in the market. Come on Nikon! D300 with GPS built-in?</li>
	<li>Somewhat "cheap&amp;plastic" feel.</li>
	<li>OFF/Auto/ON switch action is very resistant - good or bad, depends how you look at it.</li>
	<li>No cover for the 2.5mm remote jack - at least a theoretical weather seal would be nice.</li>
</ul>
So now I need a weekend with a bit of good weather for a photo trip to test it. That's going to be a looong week of waiting.
