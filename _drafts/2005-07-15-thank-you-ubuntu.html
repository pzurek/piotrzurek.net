Linux generaly is great and Ubuntu is even better, but why did it have to format the wrong hard drive? As You can see on the "screen shot" below, the drive that was supposed to be formated was <strong><em>sbd</em></strong>, my external USB drive. Of course Ubuntu partitioner didn't keep his word and formated the <strong><em>sda</em></strong> which was the main drive of sombody else's computer. Why Ubuntu? Why?
