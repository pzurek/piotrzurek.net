Well, a sort off... I have been sitting all the day under two big hot lights - just like the chicken in the farm. At the end of the day I got outside and it was not that warm any more. So I got a flu and I can have an idea where does the bird flu come from. <strong>Chicken should not be kept inside under the hot artificial light... :-)</strong>
