Today we had a trip to Piha - best surfing beach in the Auckland area. It is only 40 min. drive away and the road there goes through a chain of hills. Great views.

I am still fascinated with the NZ climate. Surfing in the middle of winter? No problem!
I have to try that one day.
Oh, and it is a VERY quite day with small waves as for Piha beach...

These are the people that have taken me under their roof and provided me with a temporary shelter. Thank You very much, Jenny and Hans! You can't see that in the picture but there is also little Sabine - 7 weeks old Kiwi.

Today is also my birthday. Thanks to the guys above I didn't feel lonely and alienated, 11 time zones away from home, family and friends.
Well, 30 is the number...
