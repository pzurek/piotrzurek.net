This is the last picture taken with my camera.

It is the last because the camera is dead. Sunken actually... I've been looking for a perfect spot to take the photo of the cave and I got washed off the rock by a big wave. The funny part is that I have to buy exactly the same camera because a week before I bought the underwater housing for it.

Anyway, to those all who have seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/" target=_blank>Vanilla Sky</a>. Do You remember Julie Gianni asking stupid question just before the crash?
This is happiness to me:

Well, of course it is never as simple as that but that was close to a place where it doesn't get any better.
