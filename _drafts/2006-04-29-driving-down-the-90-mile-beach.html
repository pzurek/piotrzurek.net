On Saturday we went all the way up to Cape Reigna and on our way back we've taken the route down the Te Paki stream and then around 60 km down the 90-mile beach. Driving through the river bed is awsome but driving 120 km/h on a flat like table beach is even cooler...

Not everyone was as lucky as us.
