So, the problem with slow drawing was indeed my fault. The calculation of every topic's position  was repeated through all previous topic on all higher levels. Now I calculate it just once for every topic and I can draw hundreds of topics in a blink of an eye. Another small step forward and I can already see a few more places for improvement.
