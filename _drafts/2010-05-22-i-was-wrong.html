...but not totally wrong.

In one of my previous <a href="http://www.piotrzurek.net/2010/03/31/autodesk-takes-autocad-and-revit-cross-platform/">posts</a> I speculated that Autodesk is planning to use Qt framework to bring its most important products to other platforms. A few days ago I was proven wrong. Now I know that Autodesk has other plans. Unfortunately I cannot share the details of what I know. All I can say is... stay tuned. There's more news coming.

On a completely unrelated note, since we almost have winter here in New Zealand I'll now go and have a cup of hot cocoa in front of the fireplace.
