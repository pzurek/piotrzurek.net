It's up to you - that's what Radiohead say when you ask how much is their latest album. The album is released in 2 versions: as download and as discbox. The discbox is basically ÂŁ40 worth of goodies which is a bit pricey, however the download version costs... as much as you wish to pay for it + credit/debit charge. I'm not the biggest fan of Radiohead, but I loved the idea so much that I ordered the download straight away. I declared ÂŁ5 as my price - it's about $10 at the moment so somewhere around what I would have to pay in the <a href="http://amazonmp3.com" target="_blank">Amazon MP3 Downloads</a>. I wonder if my order was accepted if I declared that I want to pay ÂŁ0.01? Anyway, cool marketing idea - I wouldn't buy a Radiohead album otherwise...
