So yesterday I blogged about how I don't understand why <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> doesn't offer geotagging functionality and today Google is <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/pictures-worth-thousand-clicks.html">announcing</a> the purchase of <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/">Panoramio</a> - the service that allows for viewing geotagged photos in <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> and exporting <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> files. I'm probably not going to take too much risk predicting that the next version of <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> will incorporate some kind of integration between pictures and GPS data. On a slightly related note, I uploaded some geotagged photos into Panoramio and the GPS data was not recognized - I was asked to place them on the map manually. Hopefully Google will iron out all the quirks...
