Sometimes there comes a day when You decide to buy something expensive, say camera. In order to make a good decision You google around, read lots of reviews, compare prices, technical specifications and so on and so forth. And what? You come to a clear conclusion that You have not enough money or that there are at least 4 products that perfectly match your needs/budget. Why does it happen? Beacause we rationalize to much. In that case the final point has to be irrational.

That said, to make things easier for some people: <strong>Canon is gay, and not in a good way...</strong>
