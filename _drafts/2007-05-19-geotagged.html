I just got a FedEx tracking number... <a href="http://www.di-gps.com/di-GPS/n2.htm" title="N2 di-GPS mini">My new toy</a> is on the way! So, very soon all new pictures on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/piotrzurek/">Flickr</a> will be geotagged. Yay! I was actually thinking about something more universal that I could use for navigation and not with just one camera but that thing is really neat. It's light and small and pictures come geotagged straight out of the camera. With no manual hassle. I only wish I had it half a year ago.
