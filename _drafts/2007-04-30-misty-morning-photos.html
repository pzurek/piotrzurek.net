Last week, we've had a couple of really warm days and relatively cold night. Coming from Poland, nights in New Zealand get "relatively cold" at most, never "very cold". :-) Anyway, that combination of temperatures resulted in a few really misty mornings. On one of them I got out to take some shots and it was well worth the effort.
