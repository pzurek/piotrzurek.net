I have just discovered what seems to be a problem with Flickr's GPS data interpretation. Some time ago I have noticed that some of my pictures are slightly misplaced on my Flickr map. At first I thought it is just the limited accuracy of my GPS receiver. So, I checked the data in the picture manually and according to Google Maps it was all fine. I even went a step further and checked the data from a picture downloaded from Flickr and it's also correct. So - it's just Flickr misreading the data somewhere in between.

The picture below shows the wrong placement on the left and the correct one on the right (with the incorrect above on the bridge).
