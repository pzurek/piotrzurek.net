On the night before my take off to Kiwiland, Barbara and Jo dropped by for a short visit. I mean that it was short when You consider the effort that was made to meet. They flew from Kreuztal to Berlin and then rented a car and drove all the way down to Katowice...

We've spent a few hours in a restaurant and had a lot of fun, although that was not the best moment we could choose. I had to do all my packing between 2 and 4 am, just before leaving to the airport.

BTW, 20kg is a joke when You try to pack your casual and formal clothes. I ended up without a warm formal jacket - which I hopefully won't need in Auckland.
