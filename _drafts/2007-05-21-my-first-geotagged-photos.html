Truns out it's also pretty easy to see them in Google Maps - thanks to Google's support of free and open standards, in this case GeoRSS. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.flickr.com%2Fservices%2Ffeeds%2Fphotos_public.gne%3Fid%3D97251982%40N00%26format%3Drss_200%26georss%3Dtrue%26count%3D1000&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;om=1" title="My Flickr photostream in Google Maps">Here's a link to my Flickr photostream in Google Maps.</a> That's how it looks in the browser:
