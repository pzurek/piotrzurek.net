A <strong>48 hours</strong> trip
Up and of at 4am, back at 4 a.m. 2 days later. Everything in between:

<strong>24 hours</strong> in the car
Should be less but we have wasted a few hours in the traffic jam at Autobahn

<strong>2060 km</strong> in total
Katowice-Kreuztal-Hanau-Katowice

<strong>6 hours</strong> sleep
Just a bit of rest in the middle

<strong>190 km/h</strong> in the fog!
Thank You Jo! I mean: No, thank You. :-)

<strong>Die zwei Idioten!</strong>
Barbara's reaction to a blind trust in car navigation system.

<strong>14 km</strong> <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Stau.jpg">Stau</a>
Thousands of cars standing because of one idiot causing a collision.
