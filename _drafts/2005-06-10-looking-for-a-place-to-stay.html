Well, it looks like 3 weeks from now I am going to be in Auckland for a moment (or a little longer, maybe). I will spend a lot of time in the position marked with a blue circle on the left.

Still, I need to find a place to stay and I think it would be nice to live somwhere between the blue circle and the city. Of course as close to the water as possible...
