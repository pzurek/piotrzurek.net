I managed to implement three basic layouts of topics.

<a title="Click to see a picture of a bigger map!" href="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/screenshot_215.png"><img id="image102" alt="screenshot_214_cut.png" src="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/screenshot_214_cut.png" /></a>

The next thing I'll work on, in the immediate future will be distributing all topics around the central topic so that it finally is central. I already have a idea how to do that - just no time to dress it in few lines of code.

I also started looking at the possibility of integrating Psycho with <a title="Tomboy" href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/index.html">Tomboy</a> and it seems to be fairly easily doable. Even for me. The only thing I'll need to complete before that is creating free topics (not connected with the central one) and some basic support for DnD in the map. My plan is to simply import all Tomboy notes as free topics and allow the user to define their relations graphically on the screen. It should be also possible to update the map once a previously imported note was edited in Tomboy. Maybe even some change notification... We'll see.
