Every once in a while a day like yesterday happens and I feel like shooting someone in the knee to share my pain! I've spent the last few days trying to figure out how to get the DrawingArea scroll nicely inside a ScrolledWindow. With absolutely no luck of course. I realize that I'm lacking basic knowledge so I looked for some examples all over the web. It's probably bread and butter for anyone with Gtk+/Gtk# experience, but apparently it doesn't make it well documented. Seriously, Gtk# and "well documented" should not be used in the same sentence. If there is somebody (Novell?) who cares about adoption of Gtk# for cross-platform development, they should put some effort into making it all more approachable.
On the other hand - PyGTK examples were poping up everywhere. Maybe I started learing the wrong language...
Anyway, that's what my problem looks like
...before scrolling:

<a title="Click to enlarge!" href="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot_186.png"><img id="image87" alt="screenshot_186_cut.png" src="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot_186_cut.png" /></a>

... after scroling:

<a title="Click to enlarge!" href="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot_187.png"><img id="image89" alt="screenshot_187_cut.png" src="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot_187_cut.png" /></a>

... and after re-exposing:

<a title="Click to enlarge!" href="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot_188.png"><img id="image91" alt="screenshot_188_cut.png" src="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/screenshot_188_cut.png" /></a>

All suggestions highly appreciated...
