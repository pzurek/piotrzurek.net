Wow! Two reasons to count the day as a nice one
<li><strong>the first person (except me) managed to display the map</strong>
So far a few people got to the Outline View but nobody was actually able to display the map and that is a kind of important in mind mapping software.</li>
<li><strong>the first external contribution to Psycho</strong>
Just a few lines of code but no contribution is neither too big nor too small. That one was very nice as it fixed a problem that I couldn't figure out the cause of (what a sentence).</li>
Anyway, <a href="http://ceronman.blogspot.com/" title="Manuel Alejandro CerĂłn Estrada">Manuel</a> is guilty of both. Thanks again.
