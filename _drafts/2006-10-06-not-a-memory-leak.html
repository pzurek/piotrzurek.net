So, it's all coming together quite nicely, but the problem with the speed of drawing is killing me. I'm (almost) sure that it's not a cairo related memory leak. I .Destroy() everything I can. It must be just something with my drawing procedures that iterate back and forth through the tree. Obviously I don't do it in the most effective way. The problem is I don't know many ways... I definetely need some help. Anyone, please!
