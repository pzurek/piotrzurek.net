I have been complaining about no free wi-fi access in Singapore, but there were at  least terminals with free internet access. In Frankfurt not only have You pay for it (1âŹ/10min !!!)  but also You have to use some crappy bulletproof  terminal that is really pain to use. All this airport is just a crap.
<a href="http://www.jetlag.co.nz">No-Jet-Lag</a> works. I feel fine.
OK, itÂ´s time to find my gate for the flight to Venice and that is always a bit of a challange in Frankfurt...
