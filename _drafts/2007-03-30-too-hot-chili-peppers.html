A few weeks after my last post, it turned out that RHCP is coming to Auckland to play 2 concerts. Great! No need to fly, just a short walk from home. Well, that would be too easy. Tickets have been sold out within 20 minutes and 1 person got killed by a car when standing in the queue. The tickets are still for sale on internet auctions for c.a. 300 bucks. I think I'll pass on this one...
