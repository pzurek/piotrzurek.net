Probably the first screenshot of Feisty running on VMware Fusion to hit the web.

The whole experience of installing Feisty on VMware Fusion was nothing short of impressive. When you first start Fusion, it gives you a possibility to create a new virtual machine, for which you can obviously choose a installation CD image.
In my case it was Ubuntu Feisty Herd 1 DVD image. Not a problem. Just tell me how many processors and how much memory you want to use for that vm and Bob's your uncle. The system boots up as the usual Ubuntu Live DVD and you can start the installation with the <em>Install</em> icon on the desktop. After finishing the installation it has to restart and then you can see the first sign that both of those products are not in their final, production versions.

<span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px">VMware Fusion reminds you to install VMware Tools which is also no problem and accepting all default option in the process leads you to a successful end and a few moments later you can enjoy your freshly installed Feisty in native Mac resolution. The nice thing is that the performance of that solution feels sharper on the 2GHz Core 2 Duo with 512 MB of RAM than running in regular environment on 1.8 GHz Centrino with 1 GB of RAM.</span>

I can't wait to try final Feisty on final VMWare Fusion, however it's a great pity that only one of those products is free. I won't probably spend my money on Fusion when it comes out. Although I maybe be wrong...

<strong>Update:</strong>

I have also tried the openSuse 10.2 virtual machine downloaded from Mono Downloads. Unfortunately no luck here. After powering the VM Fusion claims that the "openSUSE 10.2.vmdk" file cannot be found and that without it you can only go back to running Ubuntu in alfa version. Well done Ubuntu.
