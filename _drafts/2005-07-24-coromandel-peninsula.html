Another Sunday, another trip. Seems like it becomes a custom.
Anyway, today I have gone to Coromandel Peninsula. Well, actually it was one place in Coromandel Peninsula - Hot Water Beach. The plan was to see a little more then just that beach but my camera's battery went dead so I decided to spend a little more time on the Hot Water Beach and visit some more of Coromandel some other time.

The first interesting thing i saw was a crash on motorway. Now I know why accidents cause traffic jam. Because all passing idiots make pictures... :-)

Next stop Chile! Seriously... It is just c.a. 8500 km straight East from here.

During the low tide You can enjoy the hot sprigns in front of those rocks. I couldn't take any photos of the steam rising from the sand but belive me, it is hot...
