During the last month Autodesk has released the 2009 product line. Nothing really interesting... same old stuff as every year, you could say. Well, not quiet. Amongst all the buzz around well known products like AutoCAD, Revit and Inventor, minor additions have been smuggled drawing attention of only those who really care. One of those applications was AutoCAD Structural Detailing mentioned in <a href="http://pressreleases.autodesk.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=381%3C%2Ftd%3E" title="Autodesk Launches New Solutions for Building Information Modeling">Revit Structure 2009 press release</a>. A short quote:
<em>
The AutoCAD Revit Structure Suite now includes AutoCAD Structural Detailing, enabling:</em>
<ul>
	<li><em>Steel and reinforced concrete detailing and shop drawings</em></li>
	<li><em>State-of-the-art formwork drawings</em></li>
</ul>
What!? Structural detailing? Like ADT but for REAL engineers? Yep, that's exactly that. So why is it just a companion product to Revit Structure and why is it just getting one sentence mention instead of a separate product release? Well, politics you see. First you need to know what it is and where it comes from. AutoCAD Structural Detailing was originally conceived by <a href="http://www.robobat.com/n/us/" title="Robobat">Robobat</a> as three separate products <a href="http://www.robobat.com/n/us/519">RCAD Steel</a>, <a href="http://www.robobat.com/n/us/520">RCAD Reinforcement</a> and <a href="http://www.robobat.com/n/us/521">RCAD Formwork Drawings</a>. Because Robobat's website is still up it easy to find a lot more information about those products

So, the next thing you can expect is probably AutoCAD Structural Analysis, rebranded version of Robot Millenium - the main reason why Autodesk decided to buy Robobat in the first place.
