So, another weekend, another F# excercise. This time I decided have some fun with Cairo inside Gtk# and a port of the old <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/mcs/class/Mono.Cairo/Samples/png/knockout.cs?revision=54543&amp;content-type=text%2Fplain">Knockout</a> example from C# seemed like a prefect idea. Here's what I got:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-186" title="F# Cairo" src="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/f-cairo.png" alt="" width="420" height="449" />

Compiled executable <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/118505/FsCairo.exe">here</a>, code <a href="http://gist.github.com/28157">here</a>. Now, what I've done was pretty much a simple "translation" to get it running but I would love to make the code really functional. So, go headed and comment on what I could change to do it.

Another embarrassing udpate: fixed indentation</strong>

Update 2: indentation is broken by Wordpress editor. Code replaced with a link. </strong>
