A lunch at the office kitchen. A English, French, Slovakian and Polish seating and talking about how funny different languages sound (what else...).

<strong>Eng:</strong> Portuguese sounds weird.

<strong>Fra:</strong> Yeah. It sounds like Brazilian.

<strong>Oh really? You don't say! :-)Â </strong>
