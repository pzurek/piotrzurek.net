There is a strange feeling that I have sometimes.
When a big thunder storm occures - a one that makes the noon looking like late afternoon, turning the blue sky into dark yellow, with the wind carrying sand and everyting else it can and with a rain that seems to have inivincible plan of drowning the city - it seems to me like something must change. The world cannot look the same after such a storm. And when it all calms down and the sky becomes blue again nothing seems to have changed. Only the bird's poo on the car's windscreen seems a little washed off.

On the other hand, on a day like any other day, You come to work expecting just another pile of boring emails and You get one with a proposal to go to the other side of the globe to see what it is like there. That kind of change really deserves at least a snowfall in May...
