I just got <a href="http://www.ifolder.com">iFolder</a> running and I am really happy about it.
It looks quite nice, but makes sens only if You can make it accesible from internet - unfortunately I can't right now. For our company it would be a perfect solution for providing clients with software updates. Much easier for clients to use and install and much easier for us to maintain then the software that we're using now. Actually, looks like a good solution for a lot of problems like file transfer, sharing, backup and anything else that requires transoprting files from one place to another.
It would be nice if Google or someone like that offered free iFolder accounts. Otherwise, the whole iFolder idea won't become useful for the "mass users". Who will want to maintain his own private iFolder server, not mentioning how many people can do that. Since all the software (SimpleServer and iFolder Client) is Open Source, it wouldn't require to much effort from Google to complement their offer with iFolder service.

Anyway, if You feel like giving it a try look <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/cvs/cvsbrowse.php/*checkout*/ifolder/ifolder/HOWTOs/SimpleServer-Setup-HOWTO.txt">here</a>.
