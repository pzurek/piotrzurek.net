<strong>Awsome!</strong> All this trip was just amazing.

The first view of Mt Ruapehu. It looks a little strange in the middle of totally flat area.

Something for <em>Lord of the Rings</em> maniacs - the view of Mt Ngauruhoe which appeared in the movie as <em>Mt Doom</em>.

All those mountains are actually volcanos (some extinct and some still active) and all the area around them are fields covered with rocks thrown during eruption.

The first chair lift. Not as nice as those 6-people, foam padded lifts in Austria or Italy but it just works...

A view toward the top which is somewhere there in the clouds.

<strong><em>p.s. OK, now it's official.</em></strong>
<strong>Stap bindings are the worst crap in the world!</strong> I wasn't eligible to say that before it used it but that weekend just confirmed what I suspected. This is the third kind of snowboard bindings I have ever used. At first I have used Burton Step-in binding,s then a Flow System set. Both of them were more comfortable and gave much more control and reliability then those shitty ones I have used during this weekend. That may be the matter of quality, adjustment and so on but the time that You have to spend sittting on the snow, freezing your ass of is just ridiculous. Strap bindings do not offer anything that would justify that shortagte.
