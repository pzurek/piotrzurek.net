<strong><a href="http://amazonmp3.com" title="Amazon mp3" target="_blank">Amazon</a> selling DRM-less mp3</strong>
Good on ya,  Amazon!  I have gone straight in and bought an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6U6XY/ref=sr_f2_album_2/103-4159264-9412609?ie=UTF8&amp;child=B000V6NX8E" title="The Best Of The First 10 Years" target="_blank">Elvis Costello's album</a> (which I highly recommend) with songs that I already owned on CDs but didn't bring them over from Poland. It will be nice to listen to them again. I have paid US$8.99 for 22 songs which is a lot of bang for a buck... In order to download the whole album you'll have to install the Amazon mp3 Downloader - currently available for Windows and Mac with a Linux version coming soon. After songs are downloaded they are automatically imported into iTunes and are ready for upload to the iPod. Theoretically the service is limited to US but it's not verified otherwise than by a zip code matching to a state. So, if you've ever seen fabulous adventures of Brandon and Brenda, you'll have no problem coming up with a zip code that you can easily match with appropriate state. Anyways, seems like Apple will have to rethink their ugly monopolistic strategies. Cool stuff...

<strong>My progress with leukemia</strong>
Well, if you look at my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pxhmnw9VExwihGDPF7fevBQ" target="_blank" title="My blood picture">results</a> it seems like I haven't got it any more. Of course it's not that simple. The Philadelphia chromosome is still there and if I stop taking drugs it screw my blood picture back again. The only real way to get completely cured is getting a bone marrow transplant, but that is not really possible at the moment. But the drug works fine and hasn't got any really sever side effects. From what I noticed so far I'm getting tired very quickly. Usually around 2 p.m. I am so sleepy that I have problems keeping my eyes open. Also, if I don't eat enough before taking the drug I feel pretty sick, but that is easy to avoid. The problem is that a lot of food together with a constant feeling of being tired doesn't really improve my fitness.

<strong>Immigration stuff</strong>
I have finally decided that I haven't got much energy to spare and decided to get a lawyer and allow him (in this case her) to get it sorted for me. It's going to cost a bit but at least it's one monkey off my back. That should give me some peace of mind. I hope it's worth it because if I get kicked out I'll find myself in a real financial black hole - with no income and a lot of things to pay for.

<strong>Hacking on <a href="http://www.psycho-project.org" title="Psycho Project" target="_blank">Psycho</a></strong>
Yes, I'm back to it. Again... Currently I'm working on a style manager and at the moment I'm writing it as a separate application. After I figure out how exactly I want it to work I'll plug it into the rest of the project. I just wish I wasn't so tired in the afternoon so I could focus a little better and do some more work.

<strong>CAD on Linux</strong>
This is something that, because of my job, interest and education, I really care about. That topic appears <a href="http://www.fabianrodriguez.com/blog/archives/2007/09/11/call-for-participation-free-cad-project/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/blog/2007/09/would_you_use_proprietary_soft_1.html" target="_blank">there</a> (and even <a href="http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=67818" target="_blank">here</a> - btw, some really stupid comments here) from time to time and then disappears without any constructive result. In my opinion this whole thing boils down to two separate issues. No proprietary CAx (CAD/CAM/CAE) system running on Linux (Solaris, BSD, whatever) being one of them and no free and open source CAx that could replace (not even remotely) proprietary applications on the other side. Big dry desert and no hope for rescue. On top of that there is one more battle to lose. DWG seems to be the standard format for CAD data. Everyone who wants to exist in CAD has to work with DWG. Now, rumor has it that Autodesk has DWGx file format in works. Basically CAD equivalent of Office Open XML. The problem is that there is no ODF in CAD, so if Autodesk decides to standardise it they will have a much easier job then MS with OOXML. OK, enough about that for today. I think that I have a long post about it coming pretty soon...

<strong>Update:Â </strong>
Seems like Amazon has done something to restrict mp3 downloads to US only. I get a "geographic problem" message when I try to download anything.
