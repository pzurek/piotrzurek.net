I have received the first installment of Glivec today. It's this supposedly amazing drug that targets tyrosine kinase and prevents uncontrolled production of white blood cells. A week from now I go for a blood test to see if there's any change although it's more likely to show first signs of improvement after at least 2 weeks. For the next 10 weeks I'll be having blood tests once a week. Yay!

Also, our application for residence in NZ is finally logged with the Immigration office. Now we have to wait and see what they say. There's a good chance that we will have to put up a big fight to have a right to stay in NZ. It's probably not what I need most at the moment so I hope it's not going to be too bad. I'd rather spend my energy on other things right now.

News coming from Poland are moderately optimistic. Only 20% of people who could be treated with Glivec actually get it. I wonder if that's true...
