I went to the barber on Saturday morning. It is the same barber since a year and 7 months and I visit him every 4-5 weeks. I always go there on a Saturday morning. I'm usually there by <em>7.50-8.00 am</em>, so I am almost always the first client that day. I always get the same haircut. So this Saturday was no different. I went there, sat in the chair and then it happened. The barber asked me if I want the usual haircut? It flattered me in a way that I have become the "usual" customer so I answered "Yes, sure". After the first stripe of 3mm long hair on my head it was obvious that I haven't be promoted to a "usual" customer - I was just confused with one. So now I look like a convict. Well, at least I get some more time than usual, before going to the barber again... Oh, and no nice 50% Christmas tip for him next year.
