So finally we can see the <a href="http://laptop.media.mit.edu/">$100 laptop</a> in the real life. Green and running. The impact that it will have on the future education may be huge. An army of kids running computers with an easy to learn and use development  environment (<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono?</a>). Programming should be taught like foreign languages nowadays. Guess what <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">kind of software</a> will mostly benefit from that...

BTW, I decided to start learning programming. I have bought some books, downloaded a few others, intalled an IDE and... got stuck. It seems so easy from outside but when You have no real background it is so damn hard to start. On the other hand I am pretty determind to realize a few of my <em>prefect</em> software ideas.
We'll see...
