I use Google Spreadsheets to let everyone interested how my blood test results look from week to week. It's so cool that you can just <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pxhmnw9VExwihGDPF7fevBQ&amp;gid=1">publish</a> them for everyone to <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pxhmnw9VExwihGDPF7fevBQ&amp;gid=1">see</a>. Today I have been playing with charts and as a result of that, you can see how my white cell count looks since I have started taking Glivec. It would be nice if the chart could be created as a separate sheet but it's really a minor thing. From the first moment that I started using Google Docs it was pretty obvious that feature-wise it will be very hard to replace full blown desktop applications. Unless... there is enough added value that desktop apps cannot offer. For me there are three things that provide exactly enough additional functionality to dump desktop spreadsheet. First of them is the collaboration tools (sharing the document with others for editing), the second is the possibility to publish the document as a website for everyone to look at and the last feature that is rather hard to manage on desktop is revision management. So, I'm a complete convert - I'll never buy M$ Office (not that I ever have).

On the leukemia-side-of-things - seems like currently I'm slightly below the norm but it also looks like my blood is stabilising and I hope that in coming weeks it will climb up a bit.
