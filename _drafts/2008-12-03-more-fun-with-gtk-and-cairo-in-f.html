This time it has taken me more than I planned but I finally have something to show off.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="lightbox" href="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/screenshot-fucull.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-198" title="Fucull" src="http://www.piotrzurek.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/screenshot-fucull.png" alt="" width="462" height="370" /></a></p>

As usual the compiled exe <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/118505/Fucull.exe">here</a> and the full code <a href="http://gist.github.com/31071/">here</a>.

This week I have really struggled to figure out how to mix functional and imperative concpets. After a few days of trying to recursively build an F# list I gave up and resorted to using a ResizeArray&lt;&gt; which is simply an equivalent of C# List&lt;&gt;. I really wonder if a bit more "functional" way of building a list is possible.
