Today we're going for a ski weekend to <a href="http://www.mtruapehu.com/whakapapa_trail_detail.asp" target=_blank>Whakapapa Ski Area on Mt Ruapehu</a>. For me it is actually going to be a snowboard weekend... Anyway, it seems like a lot of fun especially that Mt Ruapehu is New Zealand's largest active volcano and the last eruption took place in 1996. I don't belive to be lucky enough to see next eruption this weekend.

So, a lot of pictures to come...
